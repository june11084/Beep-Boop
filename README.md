Project: Beep-Boop

Description: This is the independent Friday project, we are making a a beep poop converter that takes a user name and input number and prints out a range of numbers from 0 to the chosen number with the following specs:

Specs:
1. The program must be able to fill an array from index[0] to the input number, each index is equal to the corresponding integer, example if input:5, array=[1,2,3,4,5]  
2. The program must loop through the array and check if each element is divisible by 3 and not equal to 0, if true, the element is replaced with "I'm sorry," + userNameInput + "I'm afraid I can't do that."
3. The Program must then loop through each character of the element and replace the elements that contains a "1" with "Boop!", and elements that contains "0" with "Beep!"
4. The Program can reverse the answer and show only if user chooses.
5. Each Time the user converts again, reversed answer will be hidden until chosen to show again. 

Setup:
1. open git terminal in Desktop or other destination.
2. use the command $ git clone ""
3. To open portfolio in atom, use "cd BeepBoop" , then use "atom ."
